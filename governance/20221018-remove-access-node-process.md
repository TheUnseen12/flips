## Objective

With the launch of permissionless deployment of Access Nodes, the community should implement a process to address misbehaving Access nodes if necessary. This proposal intends to outline the process by which misbehaving Access Nodes, whether acting maliciously or inadvertently, should be removed from the active set in the absence of on-chain mechanisms such as minumum stake requirements or automated slashing. This proposal does not intend to define what constitutes a misbehaving node and leaves that to the discretion of the community.

## Motivation

While inclusion and execution fees are an economic deterrent to spam attacks from users who bear the cost of these fees, the multi-role node architecture of Flow presents an opportunity for certain node types to act in ways that may negatively impact the liveness of the chain.

Currently on Flow, Access Nodes require no minimum stake to be active in the network, and no automatic on-chain slashing mechanism exists within the network to disincentivize misbehavior. 

Why is this a valuable problem to solve? What background information is needed
to show how this design addresses the problem?

Which users are affected by the problem? Why is it a problem? What data supports
this? What related work exists?

## User Benefit

How will users (or other contributors) benefit from this work? What would be the
headline in the release notes or blog post?

## Design Proposal

This is the meat of the document where you explain your proposal. If you have
multiple alternatives, be sure to use sub-sections for better separation of the
idea, and list pros/cons to each approach. If there are alternatives that you
have eliminated, you should also list those here, and explain why you believe
your chosen approach is superior.

Make sure youâ€™ve thought through and addressed the following sections. If a 
section is not relevant to your specific proposal, please explain why, e.g. 
your FLIP addresses a convention or process, not an API.

### Drawbacks

Why should this *not* be done? What negative impact does it have? 

### Alternatives Considered

* Make sure to discuss the relative merits of alternatives to your proposal.

### Performance Implications

* Do you expect any (speed / memory)? How will you confirm?
* There should be microbenchmarks. Are there?
* There should be end-to-end tests and benchmarks. If there are not 
(since this is still a design), how will you track that these will be created?

### Dependencies

* Dependencies: does this proposal add any new dependencies to Flow?
* Dependent projects: are there other areas of Flow or things that use Flow 
(Access API, Wallets, SDKs, etc.) that this affects? 
How have you identified these dependencies and are you sure they are complete? 
If there are dependencies, how are you managing those changes?

### Engineering Impact

* Do you expect changes to binary size / build time / test times?
* Who will maintain this code? Is this code in its own buildable unit? 
Can this code be tested in its own? 
Is visibility suitably restricted to only a small API surface for others to use?

### Best Practices

* Does this proposal change best practices for some aspect of using/developing Flow? 
How will these changes be communicated/enforced?

### Tutorials and Examples

* If design changes existing API or creates new ones, the design owner should create 
end-to-end examples (ideally, a tutorial) which reflects how new feature will be used. 
Some things to consider related to the tutorial:
    - It should show the usage of the new feature in an end to end example 
    (i.e. from the browser to the execution node). 
    Many new features have unexpected effects in parts far away from the place of 
    change that can be found by running through an end-to-end example.
    - This should be written as if it is documentation of the new feature, 
    i.e., consumable by a user, not a Flow contributor. 
    - The code does not need to work (since the feature is not implemented yet) 
    but the expectation is that the code does work before the feature can be merged. 

### Compatibility

* Does the design conform to the backwards & forwards compatibility [requirements](../docs/compatibility.md)?
* How will this proposal interact with other parts of the Flow Ecosystem?
    - How will it work with FCL?
    - How will it work with the Emulator?
    - How will it work with existing Flow SDKs?

### User Impact

* What are the user-facing changes? How will this feature be rolled out?

## Related Issues

What related issues do you consider out of scope for this proposal, 
but could be addressed independently in the future?

## Prior Art

Does the proposed idea/feature exist in other systems and 
what experience has their community had?

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the 
lessons learned from other projects and provide readers of the proposal 
with a fuller picture.

It's fine if there is no prior art; your ideas are interesting regardless of 
whether or not they are based on existing work.

## Questions and Discussion Topics

Seed this with open questions you require feedback on from the FLIP process. 
What parts of the design still need to be defined?
